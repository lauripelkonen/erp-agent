# Cold Call Scripts for Lemonsoft Prospects

## Script 1: ROI-Focused Opening (CEO/CFO)

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi [Name], this is Lauri from ERP Agent. I'm calling because we've helped [Similar Company] save €75,000 annually by automating their Lemonsoft purchase orders and sales quotes. Since [Company Name] is also using Lemonsoft for wholesale operations, I thought this might be relevant for you. Do you have 2 minutes for me to explain how this works?"

### **If YES - Value Proposition (90 seconds)**
"Great. Here's what we do differently - instead of replacing your Lemonsoft system, we build AI agents that work inside it to automate the repetitive tasks.

For example, [Similar Company] used to spend 6 hours every week creating purchase orders manually. Now our AI agent analyzes their inventory levels, sales velocity, and supplier terms, then drafts the purchase orders automatically. Their purchasing manager just reviews and approves in 30 minutes.

The same thing happens with sales quotes - what used to take 2-3 days now happens in hours, with better accuracy and formatting.

**The numbers:** They're saving €75,000 annually in labor costs, plus they're responding to customers faster, which has boosted their sales by about 15%.

For a company like yours with [X employees/revenue], I'd estimate similar savings of €[X] per year."

### **Discovery Questions (60 seconds)**
"Let me ask you - how much time does your team currently spend on purchase orders each week?"

*[Listen, then follow up]*

"And for sales quotes, what's your typical turnaround time from request to customer?"

*[Listen]*

"Those are exactly the processes we automate. The whole setup integrates with your existing Lemonsoft environment - no system changes needed."

### **Close (30 seconds)**
"I'd like to send you a one-page overview showing exactly how this worked for [Similar Company], including their specific ROI numbers. If it looks relevant, we could schedule 15 minutes next week for a quick demo using data similar to yours.

What's the best email to send this to?"

## Script 2: Problem-Focused Opening (Operations Director)

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi [Name], this is Lauri from ERP Agent. I was researching Lemonsoft users in the wholesale space and came across [Company Name]. I'm calling because we solve a specific problem that most Lemonsoft wholesalers face - the manual work that eats up 15-20 hours per week on purchase orders and quotes. Is this something your team deals with?"

### **If YES - Problem Development (90 seconds)**
"I figured as much. Here's what we typically see with Lemonsoft wholesalers:

Your purchasing team spends hours every week doing math - checking inventory levels, calculating reorder points, comparing supplier terms. Then they manually create purchase orders line by line.

Your sales team gets quote requests and has to pull data from multiple places in Lemonsoft, calculate pricing, check availability, format everything properly... it takes days to turn around a professional quote.

And stock transfers between locations? Someone has to constantly monitor levels and manually create transfer orders.

**Sound familiar?**

What we've done is build AI agents that handle all of this automatically within your existing Lemonsoft setup. The AI learns your business rules - your preferred suppliers, markup formulas, minimum order quantities, everything.

[Customer Example] went from spending 6 hours weekly on purchase orders to 30 minutes of review time. Their quote turnaround went from 3 days to same day."

### **Discovery Questions (60 seconds)**
"Let me ask - who on your team handles most of the purchase order creation?"

*[Listen]*

"And roughly how many purchase orders are you creating per month?"

*[Listen]*

"For quotes, what's your biggest bottleneck - pulling the data or formatting the final document?"

### **Close (30 seconds)**
"This is exactly what we specialize in. I'd like to show you a 5-minute demo of how our agents work with Lemonsoft data. It's much easier to understand when you see it in action.

Are you available for a brief call later this week? I can show you specifically how this would work with your purchase order process."

## Script 3: Competitive Advantage Opening (CEO)

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi [Name], this is Lauri from ERP Agent. I'm calling because your competitors in the wholesale space are starting to use AI automation to respond to customers faster and reduce operational costs. Since [Company Name] is clearly a leader in [their industry], I wanted to make sure you're aware of what's happening. Do you have 2 minutes?"

### **If YES - Competitive Positioning (90 seconds)**
"Here's what I'm seeing in the Finnish wholesale market - companies using Lemonsoft are automating their routine ERP tasks with AI to gain competitive advantages.

**For example:**
- **Quote speed:** While competitors take 2-3 days, automated companies respond in hours
- **Purchase efficiency:** 50% reduction in time spent on ordering means lower operational costs
- **Sales capacity:** Reps focus on relationships instead of admin work, driving more revenue

We just implemented this for [Similar Company] - they're now the fastest in their market for quote turnaround, and they've reduced their purchasing overhead by €35,000 annually.

The key is that this works within your existing Lemonsoft system. No disruption, no retraining, just AI agents that learn your business rules and execute automatically.

**The strategic advantage:** Your team focuses on growth and customer relationships while AI handles the routine tasks. Your competitors are still doing everything manually."

### **Discovery Questions (60 seconds)**
"Let me ask - in your market, how important is quote turnaround time for winning business?"

*[Listen]*

"And from an operational standpoint, are you looking for ways to scale revenue without proportionally increasing overhead?"

*[Listen]*

"Those are exactly the areas where AI automation creates the biggest impact."

### **Close (30 seconds)**
"I'd like to show you specifically how this could work for [Company Name]. I can prepare a customized analysis showing your potential time savings and competitive advantages.

Would you prefer a brief 15-minute call this week, or would you rather I send you a detailed overview first and then schedule time to discuss?"

## Call Handling Framework

### **Common Objections & Responses:**

#### **"We're too busy right now"**
*"I completely understand - being busy is exactly why this matters. The companies we work with get 15-20 hours per week back to focus on growth instead of manual processes. When would be a better time to discuss how to free up some of that time?"*

#### **"We're happy with our current process"**
*"That's great to hear. [Similar Company] said the same thing initially. Then they realized they were spending €75,000 annually on tasks that AI could handle in minutes. Would you be open to a 5-minute overview just to see what's possible?"*

#### **"Send me some information"**
*"Absolutely, I'll send you a one-page overview. But let me ask - what specific information would be most valuable? ROI calculations, implementation timeline, or technical details about the Lemonsoft integration?"*

#### **"We need to discuss this internally"**
*"Of course, this affects multiple departments. Who else would typically be involved in evaluating something like this? I'd be happy to prepare materials for your whole team."*

#### **"What does this cost?"**
*"Great question. The investment depends on which processes you want to automate. For context, most clients see 3-4x ROI in the first year. I'd rather show you the specific value for [Company Name] first, then discuss the investment. When could we schedule 15 minutes for that?"*
