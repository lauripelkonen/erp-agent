## Pricing Communication

### **Never Lead with Price**
1. **Establish value first:** Show ROI calculations
2. **Create urgency:** Limited pilot spots, competitive advantage
3. **Offer choice:** Multiple tiers give control to customer
4. **Guarantee outcomes:** Remove risk from decision

### **Price Anchoring:**
**"Companies typically invest €200K+ building this capability internally. We've done that work and can deliver results in 30 days for a fraction of that cost."**

### **Objection Handling:**

**"That seems expensive..."**
→ "I understand it's an investment. What's expensive is not acting - your competitors are gaining efficiency advantages every day you wait. Let me show you exactly how this pays for itself..."

**"We need to think about budget..."**
→ "This investment pays for itself within 60 days. The real question is: can you afford to lose another €15K in efficiency while waiting for next year's budget?"
