​
Installing MCP servers
MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

​
Option 1: Add a local stdio server
Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They’re ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.


Copy
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

# Real example: Add Airtable server
claude mcp add airtable --env AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -- npx -y airtable-mcp-server
Understanding the ”—” parameter: The -- (double dash) separates Claude’s own CLI flags from the command and arguments that get passed to the MCP server. Everything before -- are options for Claude (like --env, --scope), and everything after -- is the actual command to run the MCP server.

For example:

claude mcp add myserver -- npx server → runs npx server
claude mcp add myserver --env KEY=value -- python server.py --port 8080 → runs python server.py --port 8080 with KEY=value in environment
This prevents conflicts between Claude’s flags and the server’s flags.

​
Option 2: Add a remote SSE server
SSE (Server-Sent Events) servers provide real-time streaming connections. Many cloud services use this for live updates.


Copy
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Linear
claude mcp add --transport sse linear https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
​
Option 3: Add a remote HTTP server
HTTP servers use standard request/response patterns. Most REST APIs and web services use this transport.


Copy
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
​
Managing your servers
Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:


Copy
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove github

# (within Claude Code) Check server status
/mcp
Tips:

Use the --scope flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
local (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called project in older versions)
project: Shared with everyone in the project via .mcp.json file
user: Available to you across all projects (was called global in older versions)
Set environment variables with --env flags (e.g., --env KEY=value)
Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude sets a 10-second timeout)
Claude Code will display a warning when MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens. To increase this limit, set the MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable (e.g., MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000)
Use /mcp to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
Windows Users: On native Windows (not WSL), local MCP servers that use npx require the cmd /c wrapper to ensure proper execution.


Copy
# This creates command="cmd" which Windows can execute
claude mcp add my-server -- cmd /c npx -y @some/package
Without the cmd /c wrapper, you’ll encounter “Connection closed” errors because Windows cannot directly execute npx. (See the note above for an explanation of the -- parameter.)

​
MCP installation scopes
MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

​
Local scope
Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn’t be shared.


Copy
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server --scope local /path/to/server
​
Project scope
Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a .mcp.json file at your project’s root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.


Copy
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server --scope project /path/to/server
The resulting .mcp.json file follows a standardized format:


Copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from .mcp.json files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the claude mcp reset-project-choices command.

​
User scope
User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.


Copy
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server --scope user /path/to/server
​
Choosing the right scope
Select your scope based on:

Local scope: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
Project scope: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
User scope: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services
​
Scope hierarchy and precedence
MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

​
Environment variable expansion in .mcp.json
Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in .mcp.json files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.

Supported syntax:

${VAR} - Expands to the value of environment variable VAR
${VAR:-default} - Expands to VAR if set, otherwise uses default
Expansion locations: Environment variables can be expanded in:

command - The server executable path
args - Command-line arguments
env - Environment variables passed to the server
url - For SSE/HTTP server types
headers - For SSE/HTTP server authentication
Example with variable expansion:


Copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-server": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "${API_BASE_URL:-https://api.example.com}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

​
Practical examples
​
Example: Monitor errors with Sentry

Copy
# 1. Add the Sentry MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# 2. Use /mcp to authenticate with your Sentry account
> /mcp

# 3. Debug production issues
> "What are the most common errors in the last 24 hours?"
> "Show me the stack trace for error ID abc123"
> "Which deployment introduced these new errors?"
​
Authenticate with remote MCP servers
Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

1
Add the server that requires authentication

For example:


Copy
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
2
Use the /mcp command within Claude Code

In Claude code, use the command:


Copy
> /mcp
Then follow the steps in your browser to login.

Tips:

Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
Use “Clear authentication” in the /mcp menu to revoke access
If your browser doesn’t open automatically, copy the provided URL
OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports
​
Add MCP servers from JSON configuration
If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it directly:

1
Add an MCP server from JSON


Copy
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

# Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
2
Verify the server was added


Copy
claude mcp get weather-api
Tips:

Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
You can use --scope user to add the server to your user configuration instead of the project-specific one
​
Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop
If you’ve already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop, you can import them:

1
Import servers from Claude Desktop


Copy
# Basic syntax 
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop 
2
Select which servers to import

After running the command, you’ll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.

3
Verify the servers were imported


Copy
claude mcp list 
Tips:

This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
Use the --scope user flag to add servers to your user configuration
Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., server_1)
​
Use Claude Code as an MCP server
You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:


Copy
# Start Claude as a stdio MCP server
claude mcp serve
You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude_desktop_config.json:


Copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
Tips:

The server provides access to Claude’s tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code’s tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
​
MCP output limits and warnings
When MCP tools produce large outputs, Claude Code helps manage the token usage to prevent overwhelming your conversation context:

Output warning threshold: Claude Code displays a warning when any MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens
Configurable limit: You can adjust the maximum allowed MCP output tokens using the MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable
Default limit: The default maximum is 25,000 tokens
To increase the limit for tools that produce large outputs:


Copy
# Set a higher limit for MCP tool outputs
export MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000
claude
This is particularly useful when working with MCP servers that:

Query large datasets or databases
Generate detailed reports or documentation
Process extensive log files or debugging information
If you frequently encounter output warnings with specific MCP servers, consider increasing the limit or configuring the server to paginate or filter its responses.

​
Use MCP resources
MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

​
Reference MCP resources
1
List available resources

Type @ in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.

2
Reference a specific resource

Use the format @server:protocol://resource/path to reference a resource:


Copy
> Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?

Copy
> Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
3
Multiple resource references

You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:


Copy
> Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
Tips:

Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
