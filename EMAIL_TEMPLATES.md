**Subject:** Reducing Lemonsoft purchase order time by 70% - [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] uses Lemonsoft for your wholesale operations. We've just helped [Similar Company] reduce their weekly purchase order creation from 6 hours to 45 minutes using AI automation.

**The process is simple:**
- AI analyzes your Lemonsoft inventory and sales data
- Creates optimized purchase orders following your business rules
- Integrates directly with your existing workflow

[Similar Company] saved €47,000 in the first year while reducing manual errors by 90%.

Would you be interested in a 5-minute overview of how this works specifically with Lemonsoft? I can show you actual results from other Finnish wholesalers.

## Template 3: Social Proof Email

**Subject:** How [Customer Company] automated their Lemonsoft workflow - Case study

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share a relevant success story since you mentioned challenges with manual processes in Lemonsoft.

**[Customer Company] (Similar size wholesaler):**
- **Challenge:** 8 hours weekly creating purchase orders manually
- **Solution:** ERP Agent automation within existing Lemonsoft setup
- **Results:** 87% time reduction, €35,000 annual savings

**What made this work:**
1. No disruption to their current Lemonsoft configuration
2. AI learned their supplier preferences and order patterns
3. Full audit trail and approval workflow maintained

The CEO told me: *"We wish we had done this 2 years ago. The ROI was immediate and our team can focus on strategy instead of data entry."*

Would you like to see how this applies to [Company Name]'s operations?

I can arrange a reference call with their operations manager if you'd like to hear directly from them.

Best regards,

## Template 7: Re-engagement (30 days later)

**Subject:** New Lemonsoft feature - Automated vendor negotiations

Hi [First Name],

I hope [Company Name]'s operations are going well.

Since we last spoke, we've added a new capability that several Lemonsoft users have requested:

**Automated Vendor Negotiations:**
- AI analyzes your purchase history and market prices
- Negotiates better terms with suppliers automatically
- Maintains relationships while optimizing costs

[Recent Customer] used this to reduce their cost of goods by 3.2% in the first quarter - worth €180,000 annually for their €5.6M operation.

This got me thinking about our previous conversation regarding [Company Name]'s purchase order efficiency.

**Quick question:** Are you still looking for ways to optimize your Lemonsoft processes, or have you found another solution?

If you're still interested, I'd love to show you how this new feature works alongside our core automation.

Available for a 10-minute call this week?

Best regards,  
Lauri Pelkonen
